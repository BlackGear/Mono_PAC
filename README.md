# Mono PAC

A PAC(Proxy auto-config) file generator with fetched China IP range, which helps walk around GFW.

Mono generates a much smaller PAC file than any other project does.

## Installation
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/BlackGear/Mono_PAC.git
</pre>

## Uasge
Edit config file in ./src, then:
<pre>
$ python ./src/make.py
</pre>
Both Python 2 and 3 are supported.

## Configuration
- WhiteList / BlackList:

One domains per line, # for comments. Domains will be automatic merged when generating. So you can just add domains to the list.

- ipList:

One record per line with IP/CIDR format.

Records MUST be manually sort and unique before using.

- proxyList:

Proxy config infomations in order.
<pre>
PROXY host:port   = use HTTP proxy
SOCKS5 host:port  = use Socks5 proxy
DIRECT            = Do not use proxy
</pre>

Note: Safari do not understand "SOCKS5", use "SOCKS" instead, you can also use a more compatible form like:
<pre>
SOCKS5 xxxx:xxxx
SOCKS xxxx:xxxx
DIRECT
</pre>

Note: The last DIRECT have a potential risk cause the dns pollution will affect the domains in the blackList.

Note: When you use socks proxy, whether dns resolve will through the proxy is determined by the Apps itself. When you use http proxy, the dns resolve will always through the proxy.

Testing pac generated by usufu/flora_pac

</pre>

Notes:

All Pac files except Leask-Flora_Pac.pac use a full ipList.

Leask-Flora_Pac.pac use a minimal ipList ignored the last two bytes of every ip.

All Pac files except breakwa11-gfw_whitelist.pac use O(1) algorithm to check the domains white or black list.

breakwa11-gfw_whitelist.pac does not check domains white or black list

** Mono generates the smallest PAC but provides the best performance.**

## Trivia

The code in the root field of the PAC file will be run only once.

The code in the FindProxyForURL function's field will be run each time you browser the internet.

Just test this two PAC files:

<pre>
    var unixtime_ms = new Date().getTime();
    while(new Date().getTime() &lt; unixtime_ms + 5000) {}
    function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
        return "DIRECT;";
    }
</pre>

<pre>
    function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
        var unixtime_ms = new Date().getTime();
        while(new Date().getTime() &lt; unixtime_ms + 5000) {}
        return "DIRECT;";
    }
</pre>

So put all var xx = yy in the root field will accelerate the PAC file.

PS: if code in the root field of the PAC file will be run many times, we should put the var inside the FindProxyForURL just before it being used.

## To do
- Unique, merge, sort ipList before generate.
